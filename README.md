# Sentiment-Analysis

This is a simple Sentiment Analysis Task done using Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner (VADER) which is a rule-based sentiment analysis tool for determining the emotional polarity of a piece of text. 
The analysis is done using the Amazon Fine Food Reviews dataset found on Kaggle.

How VADER works: 
-  The polarity score would return in 3 categories: Positive, Negative, and Neutral.
-  The Compound score provides the overall score of the sentiment determining whether it is positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.
-  If the compound score >= 0.05 then it is a positive sentiment
-  If the compound score <= -0.05 then it is a negative sentiment
-  If the compound score < 0.05 then it is a neutral sentiment
